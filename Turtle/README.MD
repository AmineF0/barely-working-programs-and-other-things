# Turtle!

This is a more or less complicated program written obviously in JAVA, its main purpose is dealing with files and text , trying to manage files as a data base and text to be compiled, t may a little bit primitive , but it has DONE its job and it is working.

## Use :

- There a jar that you can excecute with a OPENJDK or SUNJDK installed in your computer , everything that works for you is fine.
- It s better to make the jar file in a special folder as it may need to expand.
- There is an image in the package you can use because the show done by the program will need an image.

## Expansion :

you can contribute in this program if you want , and i will be glad to receive you ideas , from the things we can add :
- a panel where the user can edit the orders graphically .
- the integration of more functions , or variable concepts.

## Leave us a feedback.
